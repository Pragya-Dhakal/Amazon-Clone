# Amazon-Clone

 I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed  my very own first project as Amazon Clone. This project  helped me a lot to make appropriate  uses of various CSS tags and to build the basic foundation of the CSS .

 Properties that I used during this project:
-Flex properties
-Display property, units(Rem,px,%)
-Padding, margin, height ,width ,border, font-weight ,border-width
- Color, background color, background image ,size.
